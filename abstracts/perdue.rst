Radar Science and Code: Building Knowledge Beyond the Case Study
----------------------------------------------------------------

Scott Collis, Robert Jackson, Mark Picel and Zach Sherman.

The amount of data collected by radar networks and research radars around the world is vast. And the use of this data is
further complicated by a wide variety of data formats and standards. However the combination of open source, good
software engineering, open data and a renascence in HPC for Python has made the use of these data possible. This presentation
will showcase several examples of using the Python-ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) to extract geophysical meaning from radar data sets.
From decadal multi-Doppler observations in Darwin to cell tracking in Houston and data quality in Oklahoma this talk will not only
showcase the "what" but the "how". The talk will conclude by presenting the five year roadmap for Py-ART and our vision for
the future of of the open source radar community.
